        <h2>History of Vavenby</h2>
        <div class="about-text">
          <h3>First Homestead & Naming</h3>
          <p>
            In 1886, the first European resident was Franklin Allingham, who
            homesteaded a 400-acre (160 hectares) piece of land on the north
            side of the North Thompson River. This location is approximately two
            kilometres from the present-day township.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, in 1910, the original postmaster, Daubney Pridgeon, intended
            to call it Navenby after his birthplace.<br />However, the postal
            authorities misread his handwriting and the settlement was named
            Vavenby.
          </p>

          <h3>Growth with Forestry & Milling</h3>
          <p>
            According to a local history book, Upper North Thompson Reflections,
            a waterwheel-powered sawmill called Canfor was established in 1912
            by Knute Skahl and Martin Thompson. It began operations near Lost
            Creek to produce railroad ties and lumber for the Canadian National
            Railway (CNR).
          </p>
          <p>
            Over subsequent decades, multiple mills — including Weyerhaeuser and
            Slocan/Canfor — helped shape the local economy.
          </p>

          <h3>Economic Challenges & Revival</h3>
          <p>
            In 2002, the Weyerhaeuser mill closed. This resulted in job losses
            and population decline, though logging permits were retained. Then,
            in 2009, the Canfor sawmill shut down due to weak markets. It was
            reopened in late 2011 because of a $24 million investment,
            reinstating around 145 jobs. However, the mill closed again in 2019,
            this time forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Economic downturns hit the tight-knit town hard following the
            2019 mill closure. Increased demand at local food banks and concerns
            for young families were reported. Despite these setbacks, longtime
            residents like Pastor Ian Moilliet note the community's ability to
            “weather economic storms”. Moilliet said this in a

            house and they have to move on now. It's pretty difficult.” “It's
            discouraging, but we try to keep hope alive, I'm really trying to
            encourage people that there's something else around the corner.
            Don't be dismayed."
